Example implementation of SDS server
====================================

[This file](./sds.go) contains the code of Secret Discovery Service
(SDS) server that can be used for experimenting with SDS and Envoy. By
no means it can be used in production since it can serve only one Envoy
instance and it's here for illustrative purposes only.  You can read
more about SDS [in Envoy
documentation](https://www.envoyproxy.io/docs/envoy/latest/configuration/secret).

Copy the file to a directory inside your Go workspace, e.g. `$HOME/go/src/sds/sds.go`.

Then change to the directory `$HOME/go/src/sds` and type
```
$ dep init
$ go build
```

If everything is OK then a new executable `$HOME/go/src/sds/sds` gets created.

Then go to the hardcoded folder where the experimental SDS server looks for keys
and generate the first key pair.

```
$ mkdir /tmp/keys
$ openssl req -x509 -sha256 -nodes -days 365 -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout key.pem -out cert.pem
```

Run the SDS server

```
$ $HOME/go/src/sds/sds &
```

Finally you can launch Envoy. For that the following Envoy config needs to be
placed to a file, e.g. `$HOME/go/src/sds/envoy.yaml` (do not forget to update it with
your domain names you used as CN when created the SSL keys).

```yaml
node:
  id: node1
  cluster: cluster1

          route_config:
            name: local_route
            virtual_hosts:
            - name: local_service
              domains: ["*"]
              routes:
              - match:
                  prefix: "/"
                route:
                  host_rewrite: mydesk.example.com
                  cluster: service_webtest_desk
          http_filters:
          - name: envoy.router
  clusters:
  - name: service_webtest_desk
    connect_timeout: 0.25s
    type: LOGICAL_DNS
    # Comment out the following line to test on v6 networks
    dns_lookup_family: V4_ONLY
    lb_policy: ROUND_ROBIN
    hosts:
      - socket_address:
          address: mydesk.example.com
          port_value: 8008
  - name: sds_server_uds
    connect_timeout: 1s
    http2_protocol_options: {}
    hosts:
      - pipe:
          path: /tmp/sds.sock

```

Launch Envoy:

```
$ path/to/envoy  --v2-config-only -l info -c $HOME/go/src/sds/envoy.yaml
```
